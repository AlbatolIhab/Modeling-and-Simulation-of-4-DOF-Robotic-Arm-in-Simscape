# Modeling-and-Simulation-of-4-DOF-Robotic-Arm-in-Simscape
The robotic arm was initially designed in Solidworks and then imported into Simscape Multibody for analysis. To evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the robotic arm's movements, a trajectory was given to the model and solved using both inverse and forward kinematics models. The trajectory before and after the solution was then compared to assess the performance of the robotic arm.To further improve the performance of the robotic arm, a PID controller was introduced to the system, which is a widely used control strategy that can help enhance the accuracy and stability of the system. The gains of the controller were optimized using a genetic algorithm, which is a powerful optimization technique that can effectively determine the optimal values of the controller's gains. However, the optimization process was not fully completed, and further work is required to achieve optimal performance.
